```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb <-
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location/2) %>%
  select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, stars, 
         price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  ) %>%
  drop_na(stars)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(
    text_label = str_c("Price $", price, "\nStars: ", stars)
  ) %>%
  plot_ly(
    # ~ total
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price,
    alpha = .5,
    text = ~text_label
  )
